# vk-telegram_messages
Easy messages from Vk to Telegramm

You need:
1) Python 3
2) [telebot library](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI) (for easy work with bot in Telegram)
3) [vk_api library](https://github.com/python273/vk_api) (for easy work with Vk API)
4) Bot in Telegram (@BotFather helps you)

Functionality: Bot works only with text. Photo, video and another good things will be added in future... Maybe :D

Attention: It's only early version of bot. It can have problems with normal work and security of your Vk page and Telegram account.
