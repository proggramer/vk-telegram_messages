# vk-telegram_messages
Easy messages from Vk to Telegramm

You need:
1) Python 3
2) [telebot library](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI) (for easy work with bot in Telegram)
3) [vk_api library](https://github.com/python273/vk_api) (for easy work with Vk API)
4) Bot in Telegram (@BotFather helps you)
5) For parcer_of_vk_page.py you need [Beatiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/#Download/) and httplib2 (pip install httplib2) - as you can see, parcer_of_vk_page.py isn't used in project now, but I will use it in future :) 

Functionality: Bot works only with text. Photo, video and another good things will be added in future... Maybe :D

Attention: It's only early version of bot. It can have problems with normal work and security of your Vk page and Telegram account.
